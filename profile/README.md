TEMS is a flagship European initiative aimed at creating a resilient, data-driven ecosystem within the media sector.
Funded by the European Commission and involving a consortium of 43 organizations from 14 countries, TEMS seeks to enhance data management, sharing, and value extraction across the media industry.
The project focuses on developing a common media data space that facilitates cross-border collaboration and supports the adoption of a common ontology, AI capabilities and other advanced technologies.
By doing so, TEMS aims to foster economic growth and competitiveness within local and regional media ecosystems across Europe.
